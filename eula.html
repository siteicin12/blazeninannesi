To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its behalf and behalf of its affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Application, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of a course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the preceding, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the Application will meet your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems, or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>

              <p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law. The remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
              <h2>Waiver</h2>
              <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require the performance of an obligation under this Agreement shall not affect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time after that, nor shall be the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
              <h1>Product Claims</h1>
              <p>The Company does not make any warranties concerning the Application.</p>
              <h1>Changes to this Agreement</h1>
